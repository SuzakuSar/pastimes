## 🔧 Configuration Updates

### Package.json Scripts
Updated npm scripts to use new file paths:
```json
{
  "mcp:playwright": "npx @playwright/mcp@latest --config docs/mcp/playwright-mcp-config.json",
  "mcp:puppeteer": "npx @puppeteer/mcp@latest --config docs/mcp/puppeteer-mcp-config.json",
  "mcp:test": "python tests/test-puppeteer-mcp.py"
}
```

### MCP Scripts
Updated all MCP scripts to use relative paths to the new config file locations:
- `scripts/mcp/start-puppeteer-mcp.ps1` → Uses `../../docs/mcp/puppeteer-mcp-config.json`
- `scripts/mcp/start-playwright-mcp.ps1` → Uses `../../docs/mcp/playwright-mcp-config.json`
- `scripts/mcp/start-both-mcp.ps1` → Uses both config files with correct paths

### Test Files
Updated test file paths in error messages:
- `tests/test-puppeteer-mcp.py` → Updated script paths in error messages

## 📚 Documentation Updates

### README.md
Completely rewritten to reflect the new organization:
- Clear project structure diagram
- Updated installation instructions
- New documentation section with organized links
- MCP setup instructions with correct paths
- Development workflow with new organization

## ✅ Benefits of New Organization

### 1. **Clean Root Directory**
- Only essential files remain in root
- Easy to find main application files
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. **Logical Grouping**
- **Documentation**: All docs in `docs/` with subcategories
- **Scripts**: All utility scripts in `scripts/` with subcategories
- **Tests**: All test files in `tests/`
- **Configuration**: MCP configs in `docs/mcp/`

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Easy to find specific documentation
- Clear script organization
- Logical test file placement
- Updated paths throughout the project

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Intuitive file locations
- Clear documentation structure
- Organized script management
- Easy to navigate project structure

## 🚀 How to Use the New Organization

### Starting MCP Servers
```bash
# From project root
.\scripts\mcp\start-both-mcp.ps1

# Or individually
.\scripts\mcp\start-playwright-mcp.ps1
.\scripts\mcp\start-puppeteer-mcp.ps1
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Test MCP setup
python tests/test-puppeteer-mcp.py

# Test application
python tests/test_app.py
```

### Accessing Documentation
- **MCP Setup**: `docs/mcp/MCP_SETUP_COMPLETE.md`
- **Admin Guide**: `docs/admin/SIMPLE_ADMIN_GUIDE.md`
- **Development**: `docs/development/01-layout-visuals.md`

### Using npm Scripts
```bash
npm run mcp:playwright  # Start Playwright MCP
npm run mcp:puppeteer   # Start Puppeteer MCP
npm run mcp:test        # Test MCP servers
```

## 🎉 Result

Your project is now beautifully organized with:
- **Clean root directory** with only essential files
- **Logical file grouping** by purpose and function
- **Updated configurations** that work with new paths
- **Comprehensive documentation** that reflects the new structure
- **Maintained functionality** with all features working correctly

The organization makes the project much more professional and easier to navigate for both you and any collaborators! 🎯
